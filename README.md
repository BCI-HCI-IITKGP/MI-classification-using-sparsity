# MI-classification-using-sparsity
Classification of Motor Imagery EEG signal using sparsity approach

# Dataset used:

Dataset IIIa from BCI competition III.

# Installation

This project is implemented in python 2.7. 

To make easier the installation of Python dependencies, we recommend the Anaconda Python distribution. 

We recommend to install <b>jupyter notebook</b>.

In addition, the knowledge base for EEG interpretation depends on the following packages:

scipy<br>
scikit-learn<br>
pywt<br>
wyrm <br>

To support visualization of the interpretation results use <b>matplotlib</b> package.
